# Example of SOLID principle in Java

## Single Responsibility

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## Open Closed

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution

Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Interface Segregation

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion

Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
